## 🔮 Vision for Completion

**Ultimate Goal**: A shopping list app so seamless that families never lose items, never duplicate purchases, and always stay synchronized - whether one person is at home planning or another is at the store shopping.

**Success Story**: "My wife creates our weekly shopping list at home with custom categories. I get a notification, open the list on my phone at the store, check off items as I shop, and add anything extra we need. When I get home, she can see exactly what we bought and what's still needed for next time."
